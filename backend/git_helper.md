# Git Helper

1. If you open your pycharm for a new coding-session, you have to switch your Branch to "main".
You can do that by use the command "git checkout main" or use the gitDesktop.
2. Then you have to pull the current repo by using the command "git pull" or use the gitDesktop. Now you can start to code.
If you have a current branch while you are pulling you have to change to your branch and use the command "git merge main".
Now your current branch is also updated!
3. Create your own Branch git branch new_branch or use the gitDesktop
4. If you have finished your work you have to commit your branch into the repo by using git Desktop. Then you 
have to create a merge request by clicking on the button "create merge request".
5. Now everyone can see your merge request on github and can comment there. If there are no problems with the commit you
can merge your branch into the repo.
